A clean, responsive Blog Website built using HTML5, CSS3, and Bootstrap 5. <br />
This project was created as a practice exercise during my Bootstrap learning journey.
I explored components like navbar, modals, cards, carousel, grid system, and more.

> ⚠️ Note: This was a practice project to learn Bootstrap. <br />
I won’t be adding further updates to this project because I’ve now moved on to working with Tailwind CSS for better utility-first development.
